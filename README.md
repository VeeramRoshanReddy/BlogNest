## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

-   **Node.js & npm**: For running the React frontend.
-   **Python 3.8+ & pip**: For running the FastAPI backend.
-   **PostgreSQL**: A running instance of a PostgreSQL server.

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/BlogNest.git
    cd BlogNest
    ```

2.  **Backend Setup:**

    *   Navigate to the backend directory:
        ```bash
        cd backend
        ```
    *   Create a virtual environment and activate it:
        ```bash
        python -m venv venv
        source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
        ```
    *   Install the required Python packages:
        ```bash
        pip install -r requirements.txt
        ```
    *   **Database Configuration**:
        The application is configured to connect to a PostgreSQL database. You must update the connection string in `backend/database.py`. Locate the following line and replace it with your actual PostgreSQL connection URL:
        ```python
        SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URL = "postgresql://user:password@host:port/database_name"
        ```

3.  **Frontend Setup:**

    *   Navigate to the frontend directory:
        ```bash
        cd ../frontend
        ```
    *   Install the required npm packages:
        ```bash
        npm install
        ```
    *   **API Configuration**:
        Create a `.env` file in the `frontend` directory and add the following line to connect the frontend to your running backend server:
        ```
        REACT_APP_API_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8000
        ```

### Running the Application

1.  **Start the Backend Server:**
    *   From the `backend` directory, with your virtual environment activated, run:
        ```bash
        uvicorn main:app --reload
        ```
    *   The backend will be running at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

2.  **Start the Frontend Development Server:**
    *   From the `frontend` directory, run:
        ```bash
        npm start
        ```
    *   The application will open in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

Now you can visit `http://localhost:3000` in your browser, create an account, and start blogging!
